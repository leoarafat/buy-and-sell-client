          What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?

          <p>
            We can use URL to store some data e.g. The id of the current item,
            being viewed Filter parameters Pagination offset and limit Sorting
            data Keeping such data in the URL allows users to share deep links
            with others. It is recommended to avoid storing such information in
            the appâ€™s state to avoid the URL in our app getting out of sync. The
            URL should be used as the system of record, Read from it as needed
            for information related to sorting, pagination, etc. Update the URL
            as required when the settings change React Router is a great tool to
            handle routes and manage the params.

          How does prototypical inheritance work?
        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content">
          <p>
            he Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add
            methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object
            can inherit the properties and methods of another object.
            Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an
            object, we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object

          What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?
        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content">
          <p>
            The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to
            test and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an
            important step in the development process, because if done
            correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be more
            difficult to find in later testing stages.

          React vs. Angular vs. Vue?
        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content">
          <p>
            Vue provides higher customizability and hence is easier to learn
            than Angular or React. Further, Vue has an overlap with Angular and
            React with respect to their functionality like the use of
            components. Hence, the transition to Vue from either of the two is
            an easy option.
